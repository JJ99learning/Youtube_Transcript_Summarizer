# Youtube_Transcript_Summarizer
Currently works on the Youtube video that is having transcript. Using youtube_transcript_api to get the video's transcript and the feed to LLM for summarization through API.

A simple project for practicing LLM api usage.

Future improvement:
Support for non-transcript video (speech to text to extract the video content)
